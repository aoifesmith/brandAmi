# brandAmi Ambassador Eligibility Checker
This website has been created as a second portfolio for the Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Course. This is a fictitious site. The site is a brand ambassador service that is expanding its community of brand ambassadors for its clients and products it is aligned with. 'Ami' is the French translation of 'friend'. The live website can be found [here](https://aoifesmith.github.io/brandAmi)

## User Experience Design

### The Strategy Plane
The site should be intuitive to use. The site provides users with an eligibility checker form created using JavaScript, HTML & CSS. The eligibility checker should be easy to understand, simple to interactive with and give feedback to the user on inputs.

#### Purpose
The siteâ€™s purpose is to check eligibility of candidates/applicants who want to apply to become an ambassador. The site provides information to create awareness of the company and its services. It provides an application form for a user to fill out which determines if an applicant meets the eligibility criteria to become a brand ambassador. It processes user input information carrying out defensive programming techniques with validation checks on user input in order. If they do not meet criteria they will be unsuccessful in their application. The benefit of the app is to save time on a screening process not allowing a user to proceed with application if they do not meet requirements. Inclusion of defensive programming reduces human error and other risks by anticipating them and designing them out. A video tutorial is included on the site with instructions on how to apply and the eligibility criteria to be met to be a successful applicant. Information about the company, useful links and social profiles are provided for the user to create awareness of the company.

#### How does it work?
The website provides an application form which determines eligibility of applicant to become a brand ambassador with brandAmi. The user inputs their data during the application process. The site responds to the users' actions, allowing users to actively engage with data, and alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals.

#### Site Goals:

* The site users want to find out about the services of the company brandAmi.
