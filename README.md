# brandAmi Ambassador Eligibility Checker
This website has been created as a second portfolio for the Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Course. This is a fictitious site. The site is a brand ambassador service that is expanding its community of brand ambassadors for its clients and products it is aligned with. 'Ami' is the French translation of 'friend'. The live website can be found [here](https://aoifesmith.github.io/brandAmi)

## User Experience Design

### The Strategy Plane
The site should be intuitive to use. The site provides users with an eligibility checker form created using JavaScript, HTML & CSS. The eligibility checker should be easy to understand, simple to interactive with and give feedback to the user on inputs.
